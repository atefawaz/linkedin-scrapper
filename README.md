## Puppeteer and Node.js



This code is a Node.js script that uses the Puppeteer and XLSX libraries to log in to LinkedIn, scrape post data from the user's feed, and export the data to an Excel file.

fs: A core Node.js module for file system operations.

puppeteer: A Node.js library for controlling a headless Chrome browser. It is used for automating web interactions.

xlsx: A library for reading, manipulating, and writing Excel files in Node.js.
Make sure to install these dependencies before running the code.

To run this code use =>  npm start

# Web-scrapping
## Linkedin
###### using puppeteer

## 
I created a log in function and i got access to chrome  : 

- It launches a headless chrome browser using puppeteer . 

- I navigated to the Linkedin sign-in page , wrote my email and password into the corresponding input fields and submit it . 

- I took screenshots everytime for debugging purposes (sometimes the webpage closes directly).

- Created a function " autoScroll " that will scroll to the buttom of the page to load more posts .

- I extracted the Titles,Content,Published dates and Links using CSS selectors.( If the LinkedIn page structure or CSS classes change, the code may need to be updated accordingly.)

- I created an array of post objects with the extracted data and saved the post data to an Excel file using the XLSX library.

-The Excel file is named "data.xlsx" and it is saved in the current working directory.

Finally, the code closes the browser and logs a message indicating that the data has been exported to the Excel file.

## Additional notes :

- "autoScroll" : To load more content, this function scrolls to the bottom of the page. It employs page.evaluateÂ To run JavaScript code within the context of the page.
- Use an async IIFE (immediately invoked function expression) to invoke the login function: The login method is encapsulated in an async IIFE so that it can run instantly and catch any execution-related issues.
- Address any execution-related errors: An error will be detected and logged to the console if it happens during the login process or any other phase.


##  I tried to get the link of each post by clicking the threedots on the post and click on "copy link to post " , it worked only on the first post not more : 

```

  // Click on the three dots of the first post
  const threeDots = await page.waitForSelector('div > .feed-shared-control-menu__trigger');
  await threeDots.click();

// TO CLICK ON THE COPY LINK TO POST BUTTON
  async function clickCopyLinkToPostButton() {
    const buttonSelector = '.feed-shared-control-menu__item.option-share-via';
  
    await page.waitForSelector(buttonSelector); 
    const copyLinkButton = await page.$(buttonSelector);
    await copyLinkButton.click(); 
  }
  
  clickCopyLinkToPostButton();

  // TO COPY THE LINK and paste it

  const copiedLink = await page.evaluate(() => navigator.clipboard.readText());

  console.log('Copied link:', copiedLink);
```
